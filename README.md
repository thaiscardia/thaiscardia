# Hello, World! ðŸŒŽ

My name is Thais, 25 years old and just started in the tech field.
I graduated on International Relations, nevertheless, I've decided to start a career on cybersecurity after visiting several events (how not to love hacking?)
<p>Learning Python, CSS, and JavaScript at the moment.</p>
